# Lora driven room thermostat controlled via Google Calendar

The task for this project was to remotely control the temperature in 2 club rooms. Both rooms are used for events and should only be heated for these events in order to save energy. Previously, 2 very simple thermostats were installed in these rooms and someone always had to manually raise the temperature on the thermostats before the relevant events and turn it down again after the event. We wanted a solution where you can enter the events in a Google Calendar in advance and then the corresponding thermostats for the respective room are automatically raised or lowered again.
